How I passed my AZ-104 exam in 2025

Just passed the AZ-104 (Microsoft Azure Administrator) exam with a score of 935 and wanted to share my prep experience!

The exam focuses a lot on managing Azure resources, configuring storage, networking, monitoring, and handling identity and governance. It’s hands-on and definitely tests your real-world admin skills.

I used Skillcertpro practice tests throughout my prep, and they were a game changer. I’d say around 75–80% of the actual exam questions were very similar in style and content to what I practiced.

Their detailed explanations helped me nail down tough areas like role-based access control (RBAC), virtual networking, backup & recovery, and Azure Monitor. The notes were also super handy for a last-minute brush-up.

If you’re planning to take AZ-104, make sure to get hands-on experience in the Azure portal and aim for 85%+ consistently on the mocks. That combo worked really well for me!
